# Encrypted Backups

`gog backup` writes Google account data into a Git repository as age-encrypted
JSONL gzip shards. The intended repository is private, for example
`https://github.com/steipete/backup-gog`, but service payloads are encrypted
before Git sees them.

## Commands

Initialize local config, create an age identity if needed, seed the backup repo,
and print the public recipient:

```bash
gog backup init \
  --repo ~/Projects/backup-gog \
  --remote https://github.com/steipete/backup-gog.git
```

Back up all supported services:

```bash
gog backup push --services all --account steipete@gmail.com
```

Back up only Gmail:

```bash
gog backup push --services gmail --account steipete@gmail.com
```

For a bounded smoke run:

```bash
gog backup push --services gmail --account steipete@gmail.com --query 'newer_than:7d' --max 25
```

Inspect cleartext manifest metadata:

```bash
gog backup status
```

Decrypt every shard and verify hashes and row counts:

```bash
gog backup verify
```

Decrypt one shard to stdout:

```bash
gog backup cat data/gmail/<account-hash>/labels.jsonl.gz.age --pretty
```

Write an unencrypted local copy for easy reading on the Mac:

```bash
gog backup export --out ~/Documents/gog-backup-export
gog backup export --no-pull --out ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/backup/gog --gmail-format markdown
```

Use `--no-push` on `init` or `push` to commit locally without pushing to the
remote.

`status`, `verify`, `cat`, and `export` pull an existing repository or clone the
configured remote before reading. Use `--no-pull` to read local state directly.
Read commands never initialize a new Git repository when the repository is
missing or a clone fails.
With `--no-input`, backup Git operations disable credential/UI prompts and SSH
password prompts; failed read-side clones leave the configured path untouched.
Pre-created empty repository directories are supported, including mounted
paths; failed clones clean their partial contents while preserving the directory.
Git errors redact credentials embedded in remote URLs before printing command
arguments or captured diagnostics.
With `--dry-run`, all four read commands print their resolved repository/pull
plan without cloning, pulling, decrypting, or writing plaintext output.

Supported services:

- `gmail`: labels and raw MIME messages. Fetched raw messages are cached under
  the local user cache by default so interrupted full-mailbox runs can resume
  the expensive message download phase. Cached runs also write encrypted
  incomplete checkpoint commits during long fetches; use `--no-gmail-cache`,
  `--gmail-refresh-cache`, or `--no-gmail-checkpoints` to bypass those layers.
- `gmail-settings`: filters, forwarding addresses, auto-forwarding, send-as
  aliases, vacation responder, delegate visibility, POP, IMAP, and language
  settings.
- `calendar`: calendar list entries, ACL rules, Calendar settings/colors, and
  all events, including deleted events.
- `contacts`: People API contacts, other contacts, and contact groups.
- `tasks`: task lists and tasks, including completed, deleted, hidden, and
  assigned tasks.
- `drive`: shared drives, Drive file metadata, permissions, comments, revision
  metadata, and downloaded/exported file content. Google Docs export as `.docx`
  and Markdown, Sheets as `.xlsx`, Slides as `.pptx` and PDF, Drawings as PNG
  and PDF, and binary files as metadata-only unless `--drive-binary-contents`
  is set.
- `workspace`: Docs/Sheets/Slides inventory plus Forms and form responses
  discovered through Drive. Add `--workspace-native` to fetch full native
  Docs/Sheets/Slides API JSON.
- `appscript`: Apps Script projects and source content discovered through
  Drive.
- `chat`: Chat spaces and messages, when the authenticated account/API allows
  access.
- `classroom`: courses, topics, announcements, coursework, materials, and
  submissions visible to the authenticated account.
- `groups`: Cloud Identity groups the account belongs to, plus member lists.
  This is Workspace-only and requires an explicit Workspace account plus
  service-account delegation or equivalent direct-token/ADC access for
  `cloud-identity.groups.readonly`.
- `admin`: Workspace Admin Directory users, groups, and group members. This is
  Workspace-only and requires the existing Admin SDK/domain-wide delegation
  setup.
- `keep`: Google Keep notes. This is Workspace-only and requires the existing
  Keep service-account setup.

`all` expands to every supported service. Pushing a subset updates that subset
and preserves existing shards for services that were not selected, as long as
the age recipients are unchanged.

`gog backup push` enables `--drive-contents`, `--drive-collaboration`,
`--gmail-cache`, and `--best-effort` by default. Use `--no-drive-contents` for
metadata-only Drive runs, `--no-drive-collaboration` to skip per-file Drive
permissions/comments/revisions, or
`--drive-content-max-bytes <bytes>` to skip individual large Drive downloads.
`--drive-content-timeout` bounds each individual Drive export/download; timed
out files are represented as encrypted error rows so one stuck Google export
does not wedge the whole run.
Drive content exports Google-native files by default; set
`--drive-binary-contents` only when you intentionally want non-Google binary
file bytes in Git shards. Use `--workspace-native` only when you want the
heavier native API JSON in addition to readable Drive exports;
`--workspace-max-files` bounds that native fetch per file type for smoke tests.
Best-effort optional services record encrypted `errors` shards and let the rest
of the backup finish. The Gmail cache is only a local acceleration/resume cache;
encrypted backup shards remain the source of truth once a push completes.

## Files

Local config:

```text
~/.gog/backup.json
~/.gog/age.key
```

Backup repo:

```text
README.md
manifest.json
data/gmail/<account-hash>/labels.jsonl.gz.age
data/gmail/<account-hash>/messages/YYYY/MM/part-0001.jsonl.gz.age
data/calendar/<account-hash>/...
data/contacts/<account-hash>/...
data/drive/<account-hash>/...
data/groups/<account-hash>/...
data/admin/<account-hash>/...
data/keep/<account-hash>/...
data/tasks/<account-hash>/...
```

`manifest.json` is intentionally cleartext. It contains format version, export
time, public age recipients, service names, account hashes, shard paths, row
counts, encrypted byte sizes, and plaintext hashes used for verification. It
does not contain email subjects, senders, recipients, bodies, raw message IDs,
or labels.

Plaintext export directory:

```text
README.md
manifest.json
gmail/<account-hash>/labels.json
gmail/<account-hash>/messages/index.jsonl
gmail/<account-hash>/messages/YYYY/MM/<timestamp>-<message-id>.eml
gmail/<account-hash>/messages/YYYY/MM/<timestamp>-<subject>-<message-id>/message.md
gmail/<account-hash>/messages/YYYY/MM/<timestamp>-<subject>-<message-id>/attachments/<filename>
drive/<account-hash>/files/index.jsonl
drive/<account-hash>/files/<file-id>/<exported-file>
raw/<service>/...
```

`gog backup export` decrypts and verifies the manifest-backed shards before
writing files. Gmail messages become `.eml` files by default. Use
`--gmail-format markdown` for `message.md` files with YAML metadata and
extracted `attachments/` folders, or `--gmail-format both` to write Markdown and
`.eml` side by side. `--gmail-attachments none` keeps Markdown notes but skips
attachment files. Drive content shards become normal files plus an index. Other
services are written as verified JSONL under `raw/`. The export is not
encrypted; do not place it inside the backup Git repository, and keep it out of
synced/shared folders unless that is intentional.
Use `--no-pull` when exporting from a local backup repository that another
process is already updating.

## Encryption

Backups use the Go `filippo.io/age` library with X25519 age identities. There
is no backup password. The private identity is stored locally:

```text
~/.gog/age.key
```

The matching public recipient starts with `age1...` and is safe to store in
`~/.gog/backup.json` and `manifest.json`. The private `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...`
value must stay local or in a password manager.

For each shard, `gog backup push`:

1. Exports deterministic JSONL rows.
2. Gzip-compresses the JSONL with a fixed gzip timestamp.
3. Encrypts the compressed bytes with age for every configured recipient.
4. Writes only encrypted `*.jsonl.gz.age` files to Git.
5. Writes `manifest.json` with cleartext metadata for status and verification.

`gog backup verify` decrypts each shard with the local age identity, gunzips it,
checks the plaintext SHA-256 hash from the manifest, and verifies row counts.
`gog backup cat` and `gog backup export` use the same verification path before
returning plaintext.

## Security Boundary

The encrypted shards protect Google content from GitHub and anyone else without
the local age identity. That includes email bodies, subjects, senders,
recipients, raw MIME payloads, labels, Drive filenames, contacts, event titles,
and similar service data.

The manifest is not secret. It leaks operational metadata by design:

- Export time.
- Public age recipients.
- Service names.
- Account hashes.
- Shard paths and month buckets.
- Row counts.
- Encrypted byte sizes.
- Plaintext shard hashes used by `verify`.
- Backup cadence and which shards changed in Git history.

The account hash is not anonymity. It is useful to avoid putting the literal
email address in paths, but someone who can guess the address can compute and
compare the same hash.

Current trust model:

- Confidentiality: good for a private GitHub backup repo as long as
  `~/.gog/age.key` stays private.
- Integrity against random corruption: `age` authentication, gzip decoding,
  plaintext SHA-256, and row-count verification catch damaged shards.
- Integrity against repository writers: limited. Anyone with push access can
  replace encrypted backup data with different data encrypted to the public
  recipient. Keep repo write access restricted and review unexpected commits.
- Key compromise: if `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` leaks, historical shards in Git
  history may be readable. Rotate recipients, re-encrypt, and treat old Git
  history as exposed unless it is rewritten and all copies are removed.

Future hardening ideas:

- Store only ciphertext hashes in the public manifest and move plaintext hashes
  into encrypted shard metadata.
- Sign manifests or commits with a local signing key so `verify` can prove who
  created the backup, not just that the files are internally consistent.
- Add optional shard padding or disable gzip for deployments that care more
  about size side channels than repository size.

## Service Adapters

The Gmail adapter backs up:

- Gmail labels.
- Raw Gmail messages from `users.messages.get(format=raw)`.

Raw message payloads stay base64url encoded inside encrypted JSONL. This
preserves the RFC 2822 message content while keeping the shard format text
friendly.

By default, Gmail backup state is cached locally under the OS user cache
directory (`gogcli/backup/gmail/<account-hash>/`). Message-list page checkpoints
live under `list-v1/`, and fetched raw messages live under `raw-v1/`. Raw-message
cache files store the same row that will be encrypted into shards and are keyed
by a SHA-256 of the Gmail message ID, so rerunning after an interruption can
reuse already fetched messages. The encrypted message shards are streamed from
that cache in temporary per-shard files, so a full mailbox run does not retain
every raw message in RAM. Long Gmail runs report list, fetch, and shard-build
counters to stderr while stdout stays parseable. `--gmail-refresh-cache` forces
a refetch. The cache is plaintext local data; clear it if the machine should not
retain local mail copies outside the encrypted backup/export locations.

Cached Gmail runs also push incomplete encrypted checkpoint snapshots to the
backup Git repo. Checkpoint shards and manifests live under
`checkpoints/gmail/<account-hash>/<run-id>/`, are encrypted with the same age
recipients as normal backup shards, and are committed with messages like
`checkpoint: gmail backup 20000/359635`. The checkpoint manifest has
`"incomplete": true`; `gog backup status`, `verify`, `cat`, and `export` continue
to use the root `manifest.json` as the authoritative completed backup. This
keeps long runs crash-tolerant without pretending partial data is a finished
snapshot. A checkpoint commit can cover many messages, but its encrypted files
are split by both row count and a conservative plaintext byte ceiling so large
messages do not create GitHub-rejected blobs. Checkpoint commits push through a
single ordered background queue: `gog` records the exact commit SHA, continues
cached Gmail fetching, and pushes queued SHAs to the current branch one at a
time. Transient push failures are retried; GitHub hard rejections stop later
checkpoints because descendants would inherit the rejected object. The final
completed backup waits for the queue to drain, then promotes the completed
checkpoint message shards into the root manifest instead of re-encrypting the
same mailbox into a second multi-GB final push. If no complete matching
checkpoint exists, final Gmail message shards still split by row count and the
same conservative plaintext byte ceiling. Checkpoint reuse fingerprints the
exact ordered Gmail message IDs and requires the manifest run, service,
account, row count, and encryption recipients to remain compatible. Tune the
commit cadence with
`--gmail-checkpoint-rows` /
`--gmail-checkpoint-interval` on `gog backup push`, or `--checkpoint-rows` /
`--checkpoint-interval` on `gog backup gmail push`; set the interval or rows to
`0` to disable that trigger, or use `--no-gmail-checkpoints` /
`--no-checkpoints` to disable checkpoint pushes entirely.

`--include-spam-trash` defaults to true. Use `--query` and `--max` for bounded
test exports; omit them for a full mailbox scan.

The Gmail settings adapter backs up account configuration through read-only
settings endpoints. Some settings, such as delegates, can be forbidden for
consumer accounts; those errors are kept inside the encrypted settings shard.

The Calendar adapter backs up calendar list entries, ACLs, settings, colors,
and all events from each calendar. The Contacts adapter backs up contacts, other
contacts, and contact groups. The Tasks adapter backs up task lists and tasks.
The Drive adapter backs up shared drives, file metadata, permissions, comments,
revision metadata, and Google-native file exports by default. Content rows store
base64 bytes inside encrypted JSONL so Git only sees ciphertext; plaintext
export decodes them back into regular files. Non-Google binary Drive bytes are
opt-in because personal Drives can easily contain tens of gigabytes.

The Workspace adapter discovers Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms via
Drive. Docs/Sheets/Slides are already recoverable through the Drive content
exports; `--workspace-native` adds heavier native API JSON for machine-readable
recovery. The Apps Script adapter discovers script projects through Drive and
stores project metadata plus source content. Chat and Classroom adapters
enumerate data visible to the authenticated account; personal/permission-limited
accounts may produce encrypted error shards under `--best-effort`.

## Adding Services

Keep one backup engine and add service adapters. A service adapter should:

1. Resolve the authenticated account through normal `gog` auth.
2. Export stable rows without writing Google data.
3. Store sensitive identifiers, titles, names, and content inside encrypted
   shards only.
4. Add cleartext manifest counts and account hashes only.
5. Support bounded smoke flags when the service can be huge.

Good next adapters: Drive file content export, Docs/Sheets/Slides native
exports, Chat, Forms, Classroom, and Apps Script.
