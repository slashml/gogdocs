# Releasing `gogcli`

This playbook mirrors the Homebrew + GitHub flow used in `../camsnap`.

Always do **all** steps below (CI + changelog + tag + GitHub release artifacts + tap update + Homebrew sanity install). No partial releases.

Shortcut scripts (preferred, keep notes non-empty):
```sh
scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z
scripts/verify-release.sh X.Y.Z
```

Assumptions:
- Repo: `openclaw/gogcli`
- Tap repo: `../openclaw-homebrew-tap` (tap: `openclaw/tap`)
- Homebrew formula name: `gogcli` (installs the `gog` binary)

## 0) Prereqs
- Clean working tree on `main`.
- Go toolchain installed (Go version comes from `go.mod`).
- `make` works locally.
- Access to the tap repo (e.g. `openclaw/homebrew-tap`).
- For signed macOS release binaries (required):
  GitHub Actions secrets must be set, or the release workflow fails before
  producing Darwin artifacts:
  - `MACOS_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64` (base64-encoded `.p12`)
  - `MACOS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD`
  - `MACOS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` (e.g. `Developer ID Application: …`)

## 1) Verify build is green
```sh
make ci
```

After pushing the tag, confirm GitHub Actions `ci` is green for the exact tag
commit:
```sh
gh run list -L 5 --branch vX.Y.Z
```

## 2) Update changelog
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for the version you’re releasing.
- Update `internal/cmd/VERSION` to `vX.Y.Z` before tagging. The post-release
  bump workflow rewrites it to `vX.Y.Z-dev` on `main` after the tag is pushed.

Example heading:
- `## 0.1.0 - 2025-12-12`

## 3) Commit, tag & push
```sh
git checkout main
git pull

# commit changelog, internal/cmd/VERSION, and any release tweaks
git commit -am "release: vX.Y.Z"

git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"
git push origin main --tags
```

## 4) Verify GitHub release artifacts
The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` (GoReleaser). Ensure it completes successfully and the release has assets.

```sh
gh run list -L 5 --workflow release.yml
gh release view vX.Y.Z
```

Ensure GitHub release notes are not empty (mirror the changelog section).
The release workflow fails closed if macOS signing secrets are missing; Darwin
artifacts must be signed with a stable identity, not ad-hoc/linker signatures.

If the workflow needs a rerun:
```sh
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```

## 5) Update (or add) the Homebrew formula
In the tap repo (assumed sibling at `../openclaw-homebrew-tap`), create/update `Formula/gogcli.rb`.

Recommended formula shape (download GitHub release assets; preserves macOS code signature):
- `version "X.Y.Z"`
- `url "https://github.com/openclaw/gogcli/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/gogcli_X.Y.Z_darwin_arm64.tar.gz"` (or `darwin_amd64`)
- `sha256 "<sha256>"`
- Install:
  - `bin.install "gog"`

Alternative (build-from-source; macOS binary will be ad-hoc signed, which can trigger repeated Keychain prompts with `KeychainTrustApplication`):
- `version "X.Y.Z"`
- `url "https://github.com/openclaw/gogcli/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz"`
- `sha256 "<sha256>"`
- `depends_on "go" => :build`
- Build:
  - `system "go", "build", *std_go_args(ldflags: "-s -w"), "./cmd/gog"`

Compute the SHA256 for the tag tarball:
```sh
curl -L -o /tmp/gogcli.tar.gz https://github.com/openclaw/gogcli/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
shasum -a 256 /tmp/gogcli.tar.gz
```

Commit + push in the tap repo:
```sh
cd ../openclaw-homebrew-tap
git add Formula/gogcli.rb
git commit -m "gogcli vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
```

## 6) Sanity-check install from tap
```sh
brew update
brew uninstall gogcli || true
brew untap openclaw/tap || true
brew tap openclaw/tap
brew install openclaw/tap/gogcli
brew test openclaw/tap/gogcli

gog --help
```

## Notes
- `gog --version` / `gog version` should report the release version post-install.
- `scripts/verify-release.sh` checks Darwin release assets with `codesign` on
  macOS and rejects ad-hoc signatures or missing TeamIdentifier values.
